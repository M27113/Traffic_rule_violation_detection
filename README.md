# Traffic_rule_violation_detection
The main goal is designing a traffic rule violation detection system which detects and tracks the vehicles which violated traffic rules like overspeeding and wrong direction.
The python software with Tensorflow and OpenCV libraries are used to implement the proposed model.

### OBJECTIVES	
 1. Object detection with YOLOv3 deep learning method
 2. Object tracking with the Kalman filter and DeepSORT
 3. Design of Over Speed Violation Detection (OSVD) algorithm
 4. Wrong- way Traffic Violation Detection (WTVD) algorithm
 5. Comparing the results of proposed models with already existing models, to showcase the better performance of proposed algorithms.
